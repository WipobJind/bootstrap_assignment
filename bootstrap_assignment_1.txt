Answer:

When I change from col-md-6 to col-lg-6:
The two columns will stack vertically sooner. With col-lg-6, they only stay side-by-side on large screens (992px and up). So on tablets and phones, the table and text will be stacked on top of each other instead of next to each other.

When I change from col-md-6 to col-sm-6:
The columns will stay side-by-side longer. With col-sm-6, they remain horizontal even on bigger phones (576px and up). Only very small phones will see them stacked vertically.

The difference between them:
- col-sm-6 breaks at 576px
- col-md-6 breaks at 768px  
- col-lg-6 breaks at 992px
